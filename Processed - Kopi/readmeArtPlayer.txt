- Download all the files (likely using EliteHRV)
- name the files to be abel to identify the participants (I suggest naming each file with the participant id)
- for each measure file create a text file with timestamps using seconds. Use the template given. 
- Be sure to use the same name as the file the time stamps fit with but with an added "_time" to make sure the files are in order
- Set the working directory of the MIST.R script (setwd) to be the folder with the results.
- Make sure the CreateTimeAnalysisByEpisode is in the working directory alongside the result files and their timestamps
- Change the episodes in the episodes dataframe to fit with your project (or use the example)
- Name the output file at the end of the script
- Running the entire script should then output a .csv file named fdf with all the results
